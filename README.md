# PIE Aperture

PIE Aperture is designed to be a test-bed repo for the [PIE Web component library](https://github.com/justeattakeaway/pie). This repo houses text applications currently for NextJS, Nuxt and vanilla JS. These applications import the web components and ensure that they work as expected when installed in a variety of different frameworks.
